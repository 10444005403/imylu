# What does imylu do?
Most of popular machine learning algorithms have been implemented by pure Python code in the project, which is specially recommended for people who would like to learn the algorithm details by reading Python code rather than lots of mathematical formulas. However, the necessary mathematical formulas and derivations are included in the code comments.

# Why this name, imylu?
Chinese used to pronounce ML as [aimu'ailu], and the name imylu was inspired by this.

# Imylu
Chinese used to pronounce ML as [aimu'ailu], and the name Imylu was inspired by this.
This project is pure Python implementation of popular machine learning algorithms, which is specially recommended for people who would like to learn the algorithm details by reading py code rather than lots of mathematical formulas.
